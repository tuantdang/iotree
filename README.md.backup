## Abstract
In this paper, we present a low-maintenance, wind-powered, batteryfree, biocompatible, tree wearable, and intelligent sensing system,
namely IoTree, to monitor water and nutrient levels inside a living tree. IoTree system includes tiny-size, biocompatible, and implantable sensors that continuously measure the impedance variations inside the living tree‚Äôs xylem, where water and nutrients are
transported from the root to the upper parts. The collected data are
then compressed and transmitted to a base station located at up to 1.8
kilometers (approximately 1.1 miles) away. The entire IoTree system
is powered by wind energy and controlled by an adaptive computing
technique called block-based intermittent computing, ensuring the
forward progress and data consistency under intermittent power and
allowing the firmware to execute with the most optimal memory and
energy usage. We prototype IoTree that opportunistically performs
sensing, data compression, and long-range communication tasks
without batteries. During in-lab experiments, IoTree also obtains the
accuracy of 91.08% and 90.51% in measuring 10 levels of nutrients,
ùëÅùêª3 and ùêæ2ùëÇ, respectively. While tested with Burkwood Viburnum
and White Bird trees in the indoor environment, IoTree data strongly
correlated with multiple watering and fertilizing events. We also
deployed IoTree on a grapevine farm for 30 days, and the system is
able to provide sufficient measurements every day
